They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera pitch rotation**, which means upward or downward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Upward rotation – The camera rotated upward vertically.\n1. Downward rotation – The camera rotated downward vertically.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>My reason is...</rsn>\n        <ans>the number of option you choose here</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "<rsn>In the source image, the stairs appear to be viewed from a lower angle, with more of the underside of the stairs visible. In the target image, the stairs are viewed more from above, indicating that the camera has rotated downward. This change in perspective suggests a downward pitch rotation.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
