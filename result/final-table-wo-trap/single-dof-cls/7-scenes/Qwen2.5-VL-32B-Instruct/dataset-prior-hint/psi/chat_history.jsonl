However, the orientation of these objects relative to the camera appears to have changed.\n\n2. **Chessboard Orientation**: In the source image, the chessboard is slightly tilted, and the pieces are not perfectly aligned with the edges of the board. In the target image, the chessboard appears more level, suggesting a change in the camera's angle rather than the board itself being moved.\n\n3. **Perspective Change**: The overall perspective of the room has shifted. The objects appear to be in a different alignment, indicating that the camera has rotated rather than panned or zoomed.\n\n4. **Camera Roll Rotation**: The most noticeable change is the apparent rotation of the entire scene. The objects seem to have rotated around the camera's viewing axis, which suggests a roll rotation.\n\n5. **Direction of Rotation**: Comparing the two images, it appears that the scene has rotated clockwise.
