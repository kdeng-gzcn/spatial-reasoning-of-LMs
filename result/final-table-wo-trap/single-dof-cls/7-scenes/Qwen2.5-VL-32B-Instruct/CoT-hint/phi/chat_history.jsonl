They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n            Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below are some cues to help you reason through this task step by step.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated leftward (yaw rotation to the left)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted to the right relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely rotated leftward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated rightward (yaw rotation to the right)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted to the left relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely rotated rightward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Rightward rotation – The camera rotated rightward horizontally.\n1. Leftward rotation – The camera rotated leftward horizontally.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>My reason is...</rsn>\n        <ans>the number of option you choose here</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "To determine the camera movement between the source image and the target image, let's analyze the changes in the positions of objects and the overall perspective:\n\n1. **Comparison of Objects**:\n   - In both images, we can see a chessboard on a table, two monitors, and a whiteboard.\n   - The chessboard and the table remain in the same position relative to the room, indicating no significant translation or zooming.\n   - The monitors and the whiteboard are visible in both images, but their positions relative to each other have changed.\n\n2. **Position of Monitors**:\n   - In the source image, the monitor on the left is more prominent, and the monitor on the right is partially visible.\n   - In the target image, the monitor on the right becomes more prominent, and the monitor on the left is less visible.\n   - This suggests that the camera has rotated, changing the visibility and prominence of the monitors.\n\n3. **Whiteboard Visibility**:\n   - In the source image, the whiteboard is not visible.\n   - In the target image, the whiteboard is clearly visible on the left side.\n   - This further indicates a rotation of the camera, as the whiteboard comes into view when the camera moves.\n\n4. **Overall Perspective**:\n   - The change in the visibility of the whiteboard and the shift in the prominence of the monitors suggest a horizontal rotation of the camera.\n   - Since the whiteboard becomes visible on the left side in the target image, it implies that the camera has rotated to the left.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The objects remain stationary, so there is no translation or zooming.\n- The change in the visibility of the whiteboard and the shift in the prominence of the monitors indicate a horizontal rotation.\n- The whiteboard becoming visible on the left side in the target image confirms a leftward rotation.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the whiteboard on the left and the change in the prominence of the monitors.</rsn>\n<ans>1.
