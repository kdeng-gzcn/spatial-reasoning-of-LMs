The images seem to be nearly identical, suggesting that the camera remained stationary.\n\nGiven this analysis, neither \"Rightward translation\" nor \"Leftward translation\" applies. However, since the question only provides these two options, and there is no indication of any horizontal movement, we must conclude that the images are effectively the same, and no movement occurred.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>There are no noticeable changes in the positions of key elements that would suggest a horizontal movement. The images appear to be nearly identical, indicating that the camera did not move horizontally.</rsn>\n<ans>Neither option applies, but if forced to choose, the closest answer would be that no movement occurred.</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
