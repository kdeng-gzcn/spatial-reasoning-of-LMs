This further supports the idea of a camera rotation.\n\n5. **Camera Movement Analysis**:\n   - The shift in the position of the chessboard and the background elements suggests that the camera has rotated horizontally.\n   - Since the chessboard and background elements have moved to the right in the target image, this indicates a rightward rotation of the camera.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\nThe primary change between the two images is the horizontal shift of objects within the frame, which is consistent with a rotational movement rather than a linear one. The objects have not moved physically; instead, their positions relative to the camera have changed due to the camera's rotation. The direction of this rotation is rightward, as indicated by the movement of the chessboard and background elements to the right in the target image.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the shift of the chessboard and background elements to the right in the target image.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
