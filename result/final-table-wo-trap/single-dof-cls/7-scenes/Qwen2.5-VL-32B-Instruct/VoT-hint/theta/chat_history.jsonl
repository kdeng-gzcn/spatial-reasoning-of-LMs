This suggests that the camera has moved in a way that brings the upper part of the scene into a larger portion of the frame.\n- **Object Shift:** The objects (mannequin head, cables, smartphone) have not physically moved, but their relative position in the frame has changed. Specifically, they appear lower in the target image compared to the source image.\n- **Camera Movement Interpretation:** When objects appear to shift downward in the frame, it indicates that the camera has rotated upward.
