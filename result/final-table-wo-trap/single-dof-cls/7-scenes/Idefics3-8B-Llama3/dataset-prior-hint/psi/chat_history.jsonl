Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera roll rotation**, which means clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Counterclockwise rotation – The camera rotated counterclockwise along its viewing axis.\n1. Clockwise rotation – The camera rotated clockwise along its viewing axis.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>your reason here</rsn>\n        <ans>just output the index of your answer</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": " <rsn>the image appears to be the same scene, but the camera has moved from a high angle to a lower angle and has rotated so that the chessboard is in a different orientation.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>.", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
