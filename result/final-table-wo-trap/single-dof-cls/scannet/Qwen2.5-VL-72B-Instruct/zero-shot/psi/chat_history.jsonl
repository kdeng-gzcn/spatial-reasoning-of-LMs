They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Clockwise rotation – The camera rotated clockwise along its viewing axis.\n1.
