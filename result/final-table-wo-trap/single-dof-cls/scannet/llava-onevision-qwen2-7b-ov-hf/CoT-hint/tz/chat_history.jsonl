They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means forward or backward translation.\n            \n            Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below are some cues to help you reason through this task step by step.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved forward (translation forward)\n            If the objects in the target image appear larger or closer relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely moved forward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera moved backward (translation backward)\n            If the objects in the target image appear smaller or farther away relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely moved backward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Backward translation – The camera moved backward along the viewing direction.\n1. Forward translation – The camera moved forward along the viewing direction.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>your reason here</rsn>\n        <ans>just output the index of your answer</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "<rsn>Based on the given images, the objects in the target image appear smaller and farther away relative to their positions in the source image.
