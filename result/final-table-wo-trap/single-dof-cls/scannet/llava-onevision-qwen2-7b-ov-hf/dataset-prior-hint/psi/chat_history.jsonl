They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera roll rotation**, which means clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Clockwise rotation – The camera rotated clockwise along its viewing axis.\n1. Counterclockwise rotation – The camera rotated counterclockwise along its viewing axis.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>your reason here</rsn>\n        <ans>just output the index of your answer</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "<rsn>Based on the given images, it is evident that the camera has rotated counterclockwise.

The toilet paper holder and the trash can also appear to be in different positions relative to the toilet, suggesting a counterclockwise rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
