They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera roll rotation**, which means clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Clockwise rotation – The camera rotated clockwise along its viewing axis.\n1.

In the source image, the lid is closed, while in the target image, the lid is open. This suggests that the camera has moved in such a way that it now captures the open lid position. Given the options provided, the most plausible explanation for this change is a camera roll rotation, where the camera has rotated around its vertical axis. Since the lid is now open, it implies a counterclockwise rotation.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
