The relative positions of these objects to each other appear consistent, indicating no significant panning or tilting.\n\n2. **Orientation of Objects**: The orientation of the objects, such as the router and the monitor, remains the same in both images. This suggests that there is no change in the pitch or yaw of the camera.\n\n3. **Perspective Change**: The primary difference between the two images is the orientation of the entire scene. The scene appears to have been rotated slightly, as indicated by the change in the angle at which the objects are presented to the camera.\n\n4. **Rotation Direction**: Upon closer inspection, the scene in the target image appears to be rotated slightly clockwise compared to the source image. This can be observed by comparing the alignment of the window blinds and the edges of the objects in both images.\n\n### Reasoning\nThe most significant change between the two images is the rotation of the entire scene. Since the objects remain in the same relative positions to each other but are presented at a different angle, it indicates a rotational movement.
