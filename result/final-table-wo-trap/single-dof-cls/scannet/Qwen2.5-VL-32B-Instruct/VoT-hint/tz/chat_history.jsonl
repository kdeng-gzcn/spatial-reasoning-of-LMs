Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means forward or backward translation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved forward (translation forward)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         -----\n            |   ⭕️  | ---->  | ⭕️ |\n            --------         -----\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears larger or closer in the target image, the camera most likely moved forward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera moved backward (translation backward)\n\n            Example:\n            -----         --------\n            | ⭕️ | ---->  |   ⭕️  |\n            -----         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears smaller or farther away in the target image, the camera most likely moved backward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This suggests that the camera has moved further away from the wall, resulting in a wider field of view and making the poster appear proportionally smaller.\n- The additional visibility of the ceiling and the corner of the room in the target image supports the idea that the camera has moved backward, as more of the surrounding environment is now captured in the frame.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera movement between the source and target images is a **backward translation**. The poster becomes smaller, and more of the surrounding area is visible, indicating that the camera has moved away from the wall.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The poster appears smaller in the target image compared to the source image, and more of the surrounding area is visible.
