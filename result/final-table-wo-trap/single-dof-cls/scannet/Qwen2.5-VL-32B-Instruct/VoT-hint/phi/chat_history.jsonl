This suggests a change in the camera's horizontal position relative to these objects.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Perspective Changes\n- The **closet** appears to have moved more towards the center of the frame in the target image compared to the source image. This indicates that the camera has rotated horizontally.\n- The **dresser** appears to have shifted slightly to the left in the target image, further supporting the idea of a horizontal rotation.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Direction of Rotation\n- Since the closet (originally on the right) now appears more centered, and the dresser (originally more left-aligned) appears to have shifted leftward in the frame, the camera must have rotated **rightward**.\n- This aligns with the concept of rightward rotation, where objects on the right move toward the center of the frame, and objects on the left appear to shift leftward.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally, causing the closet to become more centered and the dresser to appear shifted leftward in the target image.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The closet, which was originally more on the right side in the source image, now appears more centered in the target image.

This is because objects that were previously out of frame (like the door) have now come into view on the left side.\n- If the camera had rotated to the right, we would expect to see more of the right side of the room, which is not the case here.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Provided Cases\n- The observed movement aligns with **Case 1**: The camera rotated leftward, causing objects to shift to the right in the target image.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated leftward horizontally to bring the door into view on the left side of the frame.

This suggests a change in the camera's horizontal position relative to these objects.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Perspective Changes\n- The **closet** appears to have moved more towards the center of the frame in the target image compared to the source image. This indicates that the camera has rotated horizontally.\n- The **dresser** appears to have shifted slightly to the left in the target image, further supporting the idea of a horizontal rotation.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Direction of Rotation\n- Since the closet (originally on the right) now appears more centered, and the dresser (originally more left-aligned) appears to have shifted leftward in the frame, the camera must have rotated **rightward**.\n- This aligns with the concept of rightward rotation, where objects on the right move toward the center of the frame, and objects on the left appear to shift leftward.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally, causing the closet to become more centered and the dresser to appear shifted leftward in the target image.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The closet, which was originally more on the right side in the source image, now appears more centered in the target image.

This is because objects that were previously out of frame (like the door) have now come into view on the left side.\n- If the camera had rotated to the right, we would expect to see more of the right side of the room, which is not the case here.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Provided Cases\n- The observed movement aligns with **Case 1**: The camera rotated leftward, causing objects to shift to the right in the target image.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated leftward horizontally to bring the door into view on the left side of the frame.

This suggests that the camera has moved closer to these objects rather than rotating.\n- Since there is no evidence of the objects shifting horizontally in the frame (e.g., the toilet or fixture moving to the left or right), it is unlikely that the camera has undergone a yaw rotation (leftward or rightward).\n- Instead, the camera appears to have moved forward, zooming in on the toilet and the fixture.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera movement is not a rotation but rather a forward motion, zooming in on the toilet and the fixture. However, since the question specifically asks for a horizontal rotation (yaw), and there is no such rotation evident, we must conclude based on the provided answer candidates.\n\nGiven the options:\n- **Rightward rotation**: The objects would have shifted to the left if the camera rotated rightward.\n- **Leftward rotation**: The objects would have shifted to the right if the camera rotated leftward.\n\nSince neither of these rotations occurred, and the question forces us to choose between the two, we must infer that the camera did not rotate at all. However, since the question strictly asks for a choice between the two provided options, and there is no other option for \"no rotation,\" we must select the closest fitting option based on the absence of any observable shift in object positions.\n\n<rsn>The objects in the frame did not shift horizontally, indicating no significant yaw rotation.

The blue door, which was on the far left, now occupies less space on the left side, further supporting this conclusion.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario.
