Specifically, the left side of the wall and the fire alarm box have moved out of the frame.\n   - This indicates that the camera has rotated, causing the left side of the scene to move out of view.\n\n3. **Direction of Rotation**:\n   - Since the left side of the scene (including the fire alarm box) has moved out of the frame, it suggests that the camera has rotated to the right. This would cause the left side of the scene to shift out of view while keeping the door relatively centered.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The movement described aligns with a rightward rotation of the camera.
