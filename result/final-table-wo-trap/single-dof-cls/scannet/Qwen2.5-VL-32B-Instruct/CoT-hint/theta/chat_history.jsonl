The board occupies a significant portion of the frame, and the content is clearly legible.\n- In the **target image** (Image 2), the whiteboard is still visible, but the content appears more compressed and less legible. Additionally, the bottom part of the whiteboard is no longer in view, and the top part is more prominent.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Changes in Perspective\n- The transition from Image 1 to Image 2 shows that the **bottom part of the whiteboard** has moved out of the frame, while the **top part** becomes more prominent.\n- This indicates that the camera has moved such that the field of view has shifted upward, bringing the top part of the whiteboard into a more central position while pushing the bottom part out of view.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the Type of Motion\n- The change in perspective suggests a **vertical rotation** of the camera. Specifically, the fact that the bottom part of the whiteboard is no longer visible and the top part is more prominent indicates an **upward rotation** of the camera.\n- This is consistent with the definition of **upward pitch rotation**, where the camera tilts upward, causing objects at the bottom of the frame to move out of view and objects at the top to become more prominent.\n\n### Reasoning Summary\n- The key observation is the shift in the visible portion of the whiteboard.

The board occupies a significant portion of the frame, and the content is clearly legible.\n- In the **target image** (Image 2), the whiteboard is still visible, but the content appears more compressed and less legible. Additionally, the bottom part of the whiteboard is no longer in view, and the top part is more prominent.\n\n#### Step 2: Identify Changes in Perspective\n- The transition from Image 1 to Image 2 shows that the **bottom part of the whiteboard** has moved out of the frame, while the **top part** becomes more prominent.\n- This indicates that the camera has moved such that the field of view has shifted upward, bringing the top part of the whiteboard into a more central position while pushing the bottom part out of view.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine the Type of Motion\n- The change in perspective suggests a **vertical rotation** of the camera. Specifically, the fact that the bottom part of the whiteboard is no longer visible and the top part is more prominent indicates an **upward rotation** of the camera.\n- This is consistent with the definition of **upward pitch rotation**, where the camera tilts upward, causing objects at the bottom of the frame to move out of view and objects at the top to become more prominent.\n\n### Reasoning Summary\n- The key observation is the shift in the visible portion of the whiteboard.
