This suggests that the camera was closer to the poster in the source image.\n   - In the target image, the poster appears smaller, indicating that the camera has moved farther away from the poster.\n\n2. **Perspective Changes**:\n   - The overall perspective of the room (including the curtain, wall, and furniture) remains consistent between the two images, which suggests that the camera did not pan or tilt significantly.\n   - The primary change is in the size of the objects, particularly the poster, which indicates a change in distance rather than angle.\n\n3. **Depth Perception**:\n   - The depth of field and the relative sizes of objects in the background (like the curtain and the furniture) also suggest that the camera has moved backward, as these elements appear less prominent in the target image compared to the source image.\n\nGiven these observations, the camera movement can be concluded as follows:\n\n- The poster and other objects appear smaller in the target image, indicating that the camera has moved away from them.\n- There is no significant change in the angle or orientation of the camera, as the perspective of the room remains consistent.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The primary change between the two images is the reduction in the size of the objects, particularly the poster, which indicates that the camera has moved backward along the viewing direction. There is no evidence of panning, tilting, or other movements, as the overall perspective of the room remains consistent.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
