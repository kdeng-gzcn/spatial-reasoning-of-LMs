Instead, a new workstation on the far left becomes more prominent.\n\n2. **Position of Walls and Windows**:\n   - The walls and windows remain consistent in both images, but their relative positions have changed. In the target image, the wall on the right side occupies a larger portion of the frame compared to the source image.\n   - The window blinds are still visible, but they appear more to the left in the target image compared to the source image.\n\n3. **Overall Shift**:\n   - Objects that were on the right side of the source image (e.g., the far-right workstation) are no longer visible in the target image.\n   - New objects (e.g., the far-left workstation) that were not prominently visible in the source image are now more central in the target image.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe shift in the positions of objects indicates that the camera has moved horizontally. Specifically, the objects that were on the right side of the source image have moved out of the frame, while new objects from the left side have come into view. This suggests that the camera has moved **leftward**.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has moved leftward horizontally, as evidenced by the shift of objects from the right side of the source image to being out of view in the target image, and the appearance of new objects from the left side becoming more prominent.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
