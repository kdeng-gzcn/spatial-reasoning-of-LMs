This suggests that the camera has moved rather than the objects themselves.\n\n3. **Camera Movement Analysis**:\n   - The shift in the prominence of the shower area versus the sink and mirror indicates a change in the camera's orientation.\n   - Since the objects on the shelf appear to have shifted to the right in the target image, it implies that the camera has rotated to the left. This is consistent with the definition of leftward rotation (yaw), where objects in the scene appear to move to the right relative to the camera's new position.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated leftward horizontally, as the objects in the scene appear to have shifted to the right relative to their positions in the source image.\n\n<rsn>My reason is that the objects on the shelf, such as the toiletries, appear to have shifted to the right in the target image compared to the source image.
