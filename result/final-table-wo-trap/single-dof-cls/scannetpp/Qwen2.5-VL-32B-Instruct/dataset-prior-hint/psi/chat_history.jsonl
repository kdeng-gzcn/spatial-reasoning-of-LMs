The source image has a noticeable tilt, while the target image is more level.\n   - This indicates that the camera was rotated around its viewing axis to correct the tilt.\n\n4. **Direction of Rotation**:\n   - The source image is tilted in such a way that it appears as if the camera needs to be rotated clockwise to become level.\n   - Therefore, the camera movement is a clockwise rotation.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\nThe primary change between the two images is the correction of the camera's tilt, which is achieved through a rotation around the camera's viewing axis. The source image is tilted, and the target image is level, indicating a clockwise rotation to achieve the corrected perspective.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera movement from the source image to the target image involves a clockwise rotation to correct the tilt and align the room's features horizontally and vertically.</rsn>  \n<ans>0</ans>  ", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
