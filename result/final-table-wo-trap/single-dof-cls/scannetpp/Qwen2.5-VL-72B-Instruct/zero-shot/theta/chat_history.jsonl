They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Downward rotation – The camera rotated downward vertically.\n1.

In the source image, the desk and the window appear slightly lower in the frame compared to the target image. This suggests that the camera was tilted downward in the source image and then moved upward for the target image. The objects on the desk and the wall posters also appear more centered and less angled in the target image, further supporting an upward rotation.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
