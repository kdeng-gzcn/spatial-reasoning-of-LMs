They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Rightward rotation – The camera rotated rightward horizontally.\n1. Leftward rotation – The camera rotated leftward horizontally.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>My reason is...</rsn>\n        <ans>the number of option you choose here</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "<rsn>In the source image, the focus is primarily on the refrigerator, with the left side of the fridge and the wall visible. In the target image, the view has shifted to include more of the left side of the room, such as the window, fire extinguisher, and trash can. This indicates that the camera has rotated leftward to capture more of the left side of the scene.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
