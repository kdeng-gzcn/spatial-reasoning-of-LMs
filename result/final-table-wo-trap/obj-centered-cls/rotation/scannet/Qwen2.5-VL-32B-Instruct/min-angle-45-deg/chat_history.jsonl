The primary change appears to be a zoom-in effect, where the camera moves closer to the steps and railing, narrowing the field of view.\n\n3. **Rotation vs. Zoom**:\n   - The transition does not suggest any leftward or rightward rotation. Instead, it appears that the camera has moved forward or zoomed in to capture a closer view of the staircase details.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera movement between the source and target images is primarily a zoom-in effect, focusing on the steps and railing. There is no evidence of horizontal rotation (leftward or rightward).\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The transition from the source image to the target image indicates a zoom-in effect rather than a horizontal rotation.
