However, the perspective of the table and the chessboard has changed.\n   - In the source image, the chessboard is more centered, and the chairs around it are partially visible.\n   - In the target image, the chessboard appears slightly shifted to the left, and the chairs are more visible from a different angle.\n\n2. **Chairs**:\n   - The chairs around the table have changed position relative to the camera.\n   - In the source image, the chairs are seen from a more frontal perspective.\n   - In the target image, the chairs are seen from a more side-on perspective, indicating a change in the camera's angle.\n\n3. **Whiteboard and Monitors**:\n   - The whiteboard and monitors are visible in both images but from different angles.\n   - In the source image, the whiteboard and monitors are more prominent on the left side.\n   - In the target image, the whiteboard and monitors are still visible but appear to be more on the right side, suggesting a shift in the camera's position.\n\n4. **Overall Perspective**:\n   - The overall scene remains the same, but the camera's angle has changed, providing a different view of the room.\n   - The shift in the visibility of the chairs and the change in the position of the whiteboard and monitors suggest a rotation of the camera.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe changes in the visibility of the chairs and the shift in the position of the whiteboard and monitors indicate that the camera has rotated. Specifically, the chairs that were more frontal in the source image are now seen more from the side in the target image, and the whiteboard and monitors have shifted from the left to the right. This suggests a leftward rotation of the camera.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally, as indicated by the change in the perspective of the chairs and the shift of the whiteboard and monitors from the left to the right.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
