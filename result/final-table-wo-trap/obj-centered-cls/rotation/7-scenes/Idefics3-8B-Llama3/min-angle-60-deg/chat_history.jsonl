They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Leftward rotation – The camera rotated leftward horizontally.\n1. Rightward rotation – The camera rotated rightward horizontally.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>your reason here</rsn>\n        <ans>just output the index of your answer</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": " <rsn>the camera moved from the left side of the stairs to the right side of the stairs.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>.", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
