They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Rightward rotation – The camera rotated rightward horizontally.\n1. Leftward rotation – The camera rotated leftward horizontally.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>My reason is...</rsn>\n        <ans>the number of option you choose here</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "<rsn>In the source image, the red controller is on the right side of the table, and the magazines are on the left.
