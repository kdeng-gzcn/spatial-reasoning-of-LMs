They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0. Rightward translation – The camera moved rightward horizontally.\n1. Leftward translation – The camera moved leftward horizontally.\n\n        Response Format:\n        Clearly explain your reasoning inside `<rsn></rsn>` tags, and then, provide your final decision inside `<ans></ans>` tags. \n\n        Response Format Example:\n        <rsn>My reason is...</rsn>\n        <ans>the number of option you choose here</ans>\n        ", "raw_output": "<rsn>By comparing the two images, it appears that the camera has moved slightly to the right. This can be inferred from the position of the desk and the chair in relation to the wall and the poster. The desk and chair seem to have shifted slightly to the right in the second image compared to the first.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
