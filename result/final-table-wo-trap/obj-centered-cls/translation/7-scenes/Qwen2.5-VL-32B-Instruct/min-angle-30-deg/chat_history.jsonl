In the source image, the rack is more centered, whereas in the target image, it appears slightly shifted to the left side of the frame.\n\n2. **Yellow Caution Sign**: The yellow caution sign is more prominently visible in the target image compared to the source image. In the source image, only a small portion of the sign is visible at the bottom right corner, while in the target image, the entire sign is clearly visible and occupies a larger portion of the foreground.\n\n3. **Plant and Coat Rack**: The plant and coat rack are present in both images. Their relative positions to each other have not changed significantly, indicating that the camera movement is primarily horizontal rather than vertical or rotational.\n\n4. **Overall Perspective**: The shift in the visibility of the yellow caution sign and the change in the position of the fire extinguisher rack suggest that the camera has moved horizontally.
