This aligns with a rightward rotation.\n\n<rsn>The posters on the wall shift from being more centered or on the left side in the source image to being more prominently on the right side in the target image, indicating a rightward rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n\n<ans>5</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

Its position and orientation appear consistent between the two images.\n- **Lamp**: The lamp is visible in both images. Its position relative to the dresser seems unchanged.\n- **Floor and Objects**: The floor and other objects (e.g., the black bag and the white object near the dresser) maintain their positions and orientations.\n\n### Step 2: Assess Camera Movement\n- There is no noticeable shift in the position of any object that would suggest the camera has moved forward, backward, up, or down.\n- The angle at which the objects are viewed appears consistent, indicating no significant panning or tilting.\n- The lighting and shadows also remain consistent, further suggesting no change in the camera's position or orientation.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Rotation\n- The alignment of the dresser drawers, the lamp, and other objects indicates that there is no horizontal rotation (leftward or rightward).\n- All elements in the scene maintain their relative positions, confirming that the camera has not rotated.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe camera has not changed its position or orientation between the two images. There is no evidence of leftward or rightward rotation, nor any other type of movement.\n\n<rsn>Both images show the same scene with no apparent change in the position or orientation of objects, indicating that the camera has remained stationary.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
