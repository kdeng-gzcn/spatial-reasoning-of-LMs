The overall orientation of the room and objects remains consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Type of Movement\n- The primary change is a shift in the camera's position, moving closer to the dresser. This suggests a zoom-in or forward movement rather than a rotational change.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nGiven that there is no evidence of leftward or rightward rotation, the correct answer is that there was no movement involving rotation.\n\n<rsn>The camera did not rotate leftward or rightward; instead, it appears to have moved closer to the dresser, providing a tighter focus on that area.

However, the angle at which these elements are viewed has changed slightly, suggesting a rotation rather than a translation.\n\n4. **Rotation Direction**: Since the foosball table moves from the center to the right side of the frame, and the new ping pong table appears on the left, it suggests that the camera has rotated to the left.

This suggests a shift in the camera's focus rather than a significant change in the chair's position.\n\n2. **Perspective Change**:\n   - The first image shows more of the desk and keyboard, indicating the camera was initially positioned to capture a wider view of the workspace.\n   - The second image focuses more closely on the chair and less on the desk area, suggesting the camera has moved or rotated to emphasize the chair.\n\n3. **Rotation Analysis**:\n   - The chair remains in the same physical location in both images, but the angle at which it is viewed has changed.\n   - In the second image, the chair appears to be more centered in the frame, and the background elements (like the desk and keyboard) have shifted out of focus. This indicates a rotation of the camera rather than a translation (movement along an axis).\n\n4. **Direction of Rotation**:\n   - Comparing the two images, the camera seems to have rotated to the right, as the chair now occupies a more central position in the frame, and the desk area has moved out of view toward the left side of the frame.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally to refocus on the chair.\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated to the right, as evidenced by the change in the chair's positioning within the frame and the shift in the background elements.</rsn>\n<ans>37</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
