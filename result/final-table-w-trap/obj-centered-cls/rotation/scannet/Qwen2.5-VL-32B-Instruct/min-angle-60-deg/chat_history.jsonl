The sink, which was central in the source image, is now partially out of frame in the target image.\n   - The floor and lower part of the wall become more prominent in the target image, suggesting that the camera has moved downward or the angle has changed to focus more on the lower section of the scene.\n   - There is no clear indication of leftward or rightward rotation based on the alignment of the wall tiles or other fixed elements.

The arrangement of these objects appears consistent between the two images.\n\n2. **Perspective and Orientation**:\n   - In the source image, the camera captures a wider view of the scene, including more of the surrounding area such as the floor and part of the wall.\n   - In the target image, the camera seems to have moved closer to the objects on the shelf, focusing more tightly on them. This indicates a zoom-in effect rather than a rotation.\n   - There is no noticeable change in the horizontal orientation of the camera. The objects maintain their relative positions to each other, suggesting no leftward or rightward rotation.\n\n3. **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting conditions appear similar in both images, with no significant changes in shadow placement that would suggest a rotation.\n\nGiven these observations, the primary change between the two images is a zoom-in effect, not a rotation.

The arrangement and design of these objects appear consistent, indicating they are part of the same scene.\n- **Background Elements**: The background in the first image shows large windows, potted plants, and a recycling bin. These elements are not visible in the second image, suggesting a shift in the camera's field of view.\n- **Camera Position and Orientation**:\n  - In the first image, the camera appears to be positioned further back, capturing a wider view of the room, including the recycling bin and the area near the windows.\n  - In the second image, the camera is closer to the chairs and table, focusing more narrowly on this specific area. The background elements are no longer visible.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Camera Movement\n- The transition from the first image to the second image indicates a **change in the camera's field of view**. The camera has moved closer to the chairs and table, effectively zooming in on this area.\n- There is no indication of significant panning or tilting. The camera seems to have maintained its horizontal and vertical alignment relative to the floor and ceiling.\n- The absence of background elements in the second image suggests that the camera has moved forward rather than rotating.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Rotation\n- There is no evidence of leftward or rightward rotation.

If the camera had rotated, we would expect to see a change in the angle at which these objects are viewed, which is not present.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe primary change between the two images is a forward movement of the camera, narrowing the field of view to focus on the chairs and table.

In the source image, the left chair is more prominent, while in the target image, the right chair becomes more prominent.\n- This suggests that the camera has rotated horizontally to the right, bringing the right chair into a more central position in the frame.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture the scene from a different angle, focusing more on the right side of the room.\n\n```xml\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as indicated by the change in the prominence of the chairs and the repositioning of the window in the background.</rsn>\n<ans>37</ans>\n```", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

In the source image, more of the text is readable, while in the target image, less of it is visible due to the angle.\n3. **Additional Elements**:\n   - In the target image, a trash can and a fire extinguisher cabinet become visible on the left side, suggesting a shift in the camera's field of view.\n   - The wall and window on the left side are now more prominently featured in the target image.\n4. **Perspective Change**: The overall framing suggests that the camera has rotated slightly to the left, as more of the left side of the room becomes visible in the target image.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The appearance of new elements like the trash can and fire extinguisher cabinet indicates that the camera has moved to capture a wider view of the left side of the room.\n- The change in the angle of the \"Break Room Rules\" sign supports the idea of a rotational movement rather than a linear one (e.g., panning or tilting).\n- There is no indication of zooming in or out, as the size of objects relative to each other remains consistent.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated leftward horizontally to reveal more of the left side of the room, including additional objects like the trash can and fire extinguisher cabinet.\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the left side of the room and the change in the angle of the \"Break Room Rules\" sign.</rsn>\n<ans>6</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
