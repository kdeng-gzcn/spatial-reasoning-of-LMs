In the target image, the foosball table is shifted towards the right side of the frame, indicating a change in the camera's horizontal orientation.\n\n2. **Ping-Pong Table Visibility**: In the target image, a ping-pong table becomes visible in the foreground, which was not prominently featured in the source image. This suggests that the camera has moved or rotated to include this new element in the frame.\n\n3. **Background Elements**: The background elements, such as the cabinets and the coffee machine, remain consistent in both images, but their relative positions have changed.

This indicates that there has been no significant change in the physical layout of the room.\n\n2. **Perspective Shift**:\n   - The source image shows a wider view of the room, including more of the left side and part of the back wall.\n   - The target image appears to be a closer, more centered view of the coffee table and the chairs around it.

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This suggests a slight shift in the camera's horizontal orientation.\n\n3. **Rotation Direction**:\n   - The transition from the source image to the target image indicates that the camera has rotated slightly to the right. This is evident because the right side of the couch becomes more prominent in the target image compared to the source image.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture the target image from a more centered perspective.\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as indicated by the change in the prominence of the right side of the couch and the overall alignment of the room elements.</rsn>\n\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
