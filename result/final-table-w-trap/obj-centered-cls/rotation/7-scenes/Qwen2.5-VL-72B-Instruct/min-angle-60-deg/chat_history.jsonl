They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

In the source image, the staircase is visible with a railing on the right side, and the wall on the left side is prominent. In the target image, the staircase is still visible, but now the railing is more centered in the frame, and the wall on the left side is less prominent. This suggests that the camera has rotated rightward horizontally, bringing the staircase and railing more into the center of the frame.\n</rsn>\n<ans>15</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
