This is evident because the objects on the table and the background elements appear to have shifted slightly to the left in the frame, which is consistent with a rightward rotation of the camera.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture a more centered view of the table and its surroundings.</rsn>\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
