Their positions relative to each other appear consistent, indicating no significant change in the camera's position or orientation.\n\n2. **Foreground Changes**:\n   - In the second image, there is a watermelon placed on the floor in the foreground, which was not present in the first image. This addition does not affect the camera's movement but indicates a change in the scene content.\n\n3. **Perspective and Orientation**:\n   - The angle at which the chair, cabinets, and appliances are viewed appears unchanged. There is no indication of panning, tilting, or rotation of the camera.\n\n4. **Lighting and Shadows**:\n   - The lighting and shadows in both images seem consistent, further supporting that the camera has not moved.\n\nGiven these observations, the camera has not changed its position or orientation.

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

There is no indication of a leftward or rightward rotation based on the alignment of the walls, steps, and railing.\n- The change in perspective is primarily due to the camera moving closer to the staircase, which results in a more focused view of the steps and railing.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince there is no evidence of leftward or rightward rotation, the correct answer is that there was no horizontal rotation.\n\n<rsn>The camera did not rotate leftward or rightward; instead, it moved forward along the axis of the staircase.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
