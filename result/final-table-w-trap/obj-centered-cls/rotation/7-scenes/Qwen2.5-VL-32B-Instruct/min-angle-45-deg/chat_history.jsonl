The relative positions of the monitors, the wall, and the furniture remain consistent.\n   - There is no evidence of leftward or rightward rotation based on the alignment of the objects.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The primary difference between the two images is the slight zoom-in effect, which suggests a change in focal length rather than a rotation.\n   - Since there is no indication of leftward or rightward rotation, the camera movement can be classified as \"No movement\" in terms of rotation.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera did not rotate leftward or rightward; the primary change is a slight zoom-in effect.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
