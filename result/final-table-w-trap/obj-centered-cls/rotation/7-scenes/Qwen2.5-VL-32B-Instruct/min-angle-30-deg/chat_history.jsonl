In the target image, more of the left side of the desk is visible compared to the source image. This suggests a slight shift in the camera's position or angle.\n\n4. **Rotation Analysis**: The change in perspective indicates that the camera has rotated slightly to the left. This is evident because more of the left side of the desk is now visible in the target image.\n\nGiven this analysis, the camera movement can be described as a leftward rotation.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally, as indicated by the increased visibility of the left side of the desk in the target image.</rsn>  \n<ans>55</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

There is also a poster on the wall and some sculptures on the left side.\n   - In the target image (Image 2), the desk, chair, and dual monitors are still visible, but the perspective has shifted slightly. The sculptures on the left side are no longer visible, and the poster on the wall is out of frame.\n\n2. **Position of the Desk and Chair**:\n   - Both images show the same desk and chair, indicating that the camera is focused on the same general area.\n   - However, the angle at which the desk and chair are viewed has changed. The left side of the desk is less visible in Image 2 compared to Image 1.\n\n3. **Wall and Poster**:\n   - The poster on the wall is clearly visible in Image 1 but is not visible in Image 2. This suggests that the camera has moved or rotated away from the left side of the room.\n\n4. **Overall Perspective**:\n   - The shift in the visibility of the left side of the room (sculptures and poster) indicates a rotation of the camera. Since these elements are no longer in view, it suggests a rightward rotation.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe camera appears to have rotated rightward horizontally, as the left side of the room (including the sculptures and the poster) is no longer visible in the target image. The desk and chair remain in view but from a different angle, supporting the idea of a rotational movement rather than a linear one.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the change in the visibility of elements on the left side of the room.</rsn>\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
