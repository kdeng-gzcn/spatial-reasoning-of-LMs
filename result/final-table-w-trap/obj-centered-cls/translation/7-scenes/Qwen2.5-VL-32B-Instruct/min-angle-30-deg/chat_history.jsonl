This suggests no significant change in the position of these objects.\n\n2. **Yellow Caution Sign**: The yellow caution sign is more prominently visible in the target image compared to the source image. It appears to be closer to the camera in the target image, indicating a possible change in the camera's position.\n\n3. **Plant**: The plant is also visible in both images, and its position relative to the fire extinguishers and the caution sign seems consistent. However, the angle at which it is viewed has changed slightly, suggesting a shift in the camera's perspective.\n\n4. **Overall Composition**: The overall composition of the scene remains similar, but there is a noticeable difference in the framing. The target image shows more of the floor and less of the upper part of the scene, indicating a downward tilt or a slight change in the camera's angle.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The primary change between the two images is the increased prominence of the yellow caution sign in the target image. This suggests that the camera has moved closer to the sign.\n- There is no clear indication of leftward or rightward horizontal translation.

This suggests no significant horizontal movement of the camera.\n\n2. **Fire Extinguishers**:\n   - The fire extinguishers are visible in both images, and their positions relative to each other and the caution sign appear consistent. There is no indication of a shift in their placement that would suggest camera movement.\n\n3. **Plant**:\n   - The plant is also present in both images.

The arrangement of these objects appears consistent between the two images.\n\n2. **Chair Position**: The chair in both images is in the same relative position to the desk, indicating no significant change in the chair's placement.\n\n3. **Perspective Shift**: Upon closer inspection, the angle and framing of the images suggest a slight shift in the camera's position. The target image appears to be taken from a slightly different angle compared to the source image, with more emphasis on the left side of the desk.\n\n4. **Background Elements**: The background elements, such as the wall and the items on the shelf, remain consistent in both images, further supporting that the primary change is in the camera's position rather than the scene itself.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe subtle difference in the framing and angle suggests that the camera has moved slightly to the left. This is evident because more of the left side of the desk and the adjacent area are visible in the target image compared to the source image.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has moved leftward horizontally, as indicated by the increased visibility of the left side of the desk and the surrounding area in the target image.</rsn>\n<ans>55</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

There is also a poster on the wall and some sculptures on the left side.\n   - In the target image (Image 2), the desk, chair, and dual monitors are still visible, but the sculptures on the left side are no longer in view. Additionally, the poster on the wall is not visible in the target image.\n\n2. **Positional Changes**:\n   - The absence of the sculptures and the poster suggests that the camera has moved away from the left side of the room.\n   - The overall perspective of the desk and chair remains consistent, indicating that the camera has not significantly changed its angle or zoom level.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the left-side elements (sculptures and poster) are no longer visible, it implies that the camera has moved rightward horizontally.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has moved rightward horizontally, as indicated by the disappearance of elements on the left side of the room.</rsn>\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
