Their relative positions to each other appear consistent, indicating no significant change in the scene composition.\n\n2. **Foreground Changes**:\n   - In the second image, there is a watermelon placed on the floor near the foreground, which was not present in the first image. This suggests a change in the scene content rather than a change in camera position.\n\n3. **Camera Position and Orientation**:\n   - The angle and framing of the chair, cabinets, and appliances remain largely the same in both images. There is no noticeable shift in the perspective that would indicate the camera has moved leftward or rightward.\n\n4. **Focus and Clarity**:\n   - The second image appears slightly blurrier compared to the first one, which could be due to a change in focus settings rather than camera movement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that the objects' relative positions have not changed and there is no indication of a shift in the camera's horizontal position, it is reasonable to conclude that the camera did not move horizontally (leftward or rightward).\n\n<rsn>The objects in the scene maintain their relative positions, and the only difference is the addition of a watermelon in the second image. There is no evidence of horizontal camera movement.</rsn>\n\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
