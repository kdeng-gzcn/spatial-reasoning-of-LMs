The arrangement of these items appears consistent between the two images, suggesting no significant change in the camera's vertical or horizontal position relative to the table.\n\n2. **Background Elements**:\n   - The background includes a red cabinet, shelves with various items, and a tiled wall. These elements remain largely unchanged in their positions and orientations, indicating that the camera has not moved significantly in terms of panning or tilting.\n\n3. **Perspective and Position**:\n   - Upon close inspection, the perspective of the room and the relative positions of objects such as the chairs, table, and background items appear consistent. There are no noticeable shifts in the alignment of these elements that would suggest a leftward or rightward translation.\n\n4. **Additional Items**:\n   - In the target image, there is a new object on the right side of the table (a container with a pen and a red object resembling a game controller). This suggests that the camera's field of view has shifted slightly to the right, allowing these additional items to come into view. However, the overall composition and alignment of the main elements remain consistent.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary difference between the two images is the visibility of additional items on the right side of the table in the target image.

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs.

The mug, book, plastic container, and red controller are in similar positions relative to each other.\n   - The background elements, such as the shelves and TV screen, also appear unchanged in their placement.\n\n3. **Perspective and Angle**:\n   - The perspective of the room seems slightly different. In the target image, more of the right side of the table and chair is visible compared to the source image.\n   - This suggests a shift in the camera's position rather than a rotation or zoom.\n\n4. **Camera Movement**:\n   - The increased visibility of the right side of the table and chair indicates that the camera has moved to the right.\n   - There is no significant change in the height or angle of the camera, so it is likely a horizontal translation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has moved rightward horizontally to capture more of the right side of the table and chair.\n\n<rsn>The key difference between the two images is the increased visibility of the right side of the table and chair, indicating a rightward translation of the camera. All other elements remain consistent in their positions, supporting the conclusion of a horizontal movement.</rsn>\n\n<ans>25.
