This suggests a forward movement rather than a lateral (leftward or rightward) movement.\n- There is no clear indication of the camera panning left or right; instead, the change in perspective is due to the camera moving forward and focusing more closely on the dresser area.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Options\n- The options provided are primarily about horizontal translations (leftward or rightward), but the movement observed is more of a forward translation.\n- Since none of the options explicitly mention forward movement, and the closest match would be \"No movement\" if we strictly adhere to the given choices, we must select the most appropriate one based on the available options.\n\n### Final Decision\nGiven the analysis, the camera did not move leftward or rightward horizontally. Therefore, the correct answer is that there was no movement in terms of leftward or rightward translation.\n\n<rsn>The camera did not move leftward or rightward horizontally. Instead, it appears to have moved forward, focusing more closely on the dresser area. However, since the options only include leftward, rightward, or no movement, the best choice is \"No movement.\"</rsn>\n<ans>17</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

This suggests a shift in the camera's field of view rather than a physical movement of the objects.\n\n2. **Perspective and Position**:\n   - The chair remains in the foreground in both images, indicating that the camera has not moved significantly in terms of distance from the chair.\n   - The background elements, such as the desk and keyboard, have shifted out of the frame in the second image, suggesting a horizontal movement of the camera.\n\n3. **Direction of Movement**:\n   - The second image shows less of the desk and more of the floor area to the right side of the chair compared to the first image. This indicates that the camera has moved to the right, as more of the right side of the scene is now visible.\n\nGiven these observations, the camera has moved horizontally to the right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has moved horizontally to the right, as indicated by the change in the visible portion of the scene, with more of the right side becoming visible and less of the desk remaining in the frame.</rsn>\n<ans>37</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
