The coffee table and the seating arrangement are visible, but the background elements (like the TV and the wall art) are less prominent.\n- **Target Image**: The camera seems to have moved slightly backward or zoomed out, as more of the room is visible, including the entire coffee table, the seating arrangement, and the background elements like the TV and wall art. The foreground furniture (chair) is no longer prominently in view.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Horizontal Movement\n- There is no noticeable horizontal shift in the positioning of objects. The relative alignment of the furniture (chairs, coffee table, TV, etc.) remains consistent between the two images. This suggests there is no significant leftward or rightward translation.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Vertical and Depth Changes\n- The primary difference is in the depth of field. The target image shows a wider view of the room, indicating that the camera has either moved backward or zoomed out. However, since the question specifically asks about horizontal translation (leftward or rightward), we can conclude that there is no such movement.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe camera did not move horizontally (leftward or rightward). The change in perspective is due to a backward movement or zooming out, but this does not affect the horizontal translation.\n\n```xml\n<rsn>The comparison of key objects and their positions indicates no significant leftward or rightward movement.

In the second image, more of the left side of the sofa is visible compared to the first image.\n   - This suggests that the camera has shifted slightly to the left, allowing more of the left side of the sofa to come into view.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the increased visibility of the left side of the sofa, it indicates that the camera has moved leftward horizontally.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n<rsn>The camera has moved leftward horizontally, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the left side of the sofa in the second image.</rsn>\n<ans>12</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
