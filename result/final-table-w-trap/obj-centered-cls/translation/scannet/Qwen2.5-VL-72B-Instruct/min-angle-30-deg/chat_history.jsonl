They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            Note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera while centering on the same scene. To simplify this question, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on the **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
