The arrangement and relative positions of these objects appear consistent between the two images.\n\n2. **Camera Position**: There is no noticeable shift in the camera's horizontal or vertical position. The objects remain in the same place relative to each other, indicating that the camera has not moved forward, backward, left, or right.\n\n3. **Rotation**: There is no apparent rotation of the camera. The angles at which the objects are viewed seem identical in both images.\n\n4. **Focus and Clarity**: The primary difference between the two images is the focus. The source image is blurry, while the target image is clearer. However, this difference in focus does not indicate a change in camera position or orientation; it suggests a change in the camera's focus settings rather than a physical movement.\n\nGiven these observations, the camera has not changed its position or orientation. The only difference is the focus clarity, which is not related to camera movement.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has not changed its position or orientation.

The surrounding environment, including the chairs, table, and background items, appears consistent between the two images.\n\n2. **Perspective Changes**:\n   - The angle at which the chessboard is viewed seems slightly different.

There are no discernible changes in the camera's viewpoint, indicating no movement.</rsn>\n\n<ans>0.
