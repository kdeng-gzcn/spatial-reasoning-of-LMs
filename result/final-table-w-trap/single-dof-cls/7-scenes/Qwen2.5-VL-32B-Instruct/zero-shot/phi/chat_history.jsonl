The desk, chair, and shelving unit are in the same positions relative to the camera, indicating that there has been no substantial panning or tilting.\n\n3. **Focus and Clarity**: Both images are blurry, which might suggest that the focus settings on the camera were not adjusted between the two shots. However, this does not affect the determination of camera movement.\n\n4. **Perspective**: The perspective of the room remains consistent between the two images. There are no indications of zooming in or out, as the sizes of objects in relation to each other remain unchanged.\n\nGiven these observations, it appears that the camera did not move between the two images. The slight differences in blur and lighting could be due to factors other than camera movement, such as changes in lighting conditions or focus adjustments.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>There is no noticeable change in the camera's position, orientation, or perspective between the two images.
