This blurriness could be due to motion blur, indicating that the camera might have moved while capturing the image.\n\n3. **Perspective Shift**:\n   - There is no apparent change in the perspective or angle of the objects, which suggests that the camera did not pan or tilt significantly.\n   - However, the blurriness in the target image implies that the camera might have rotated slightly, causing the motion blur.\n\n4. **Camera Rotation**:\n   - The objects in the target image do not show a clear shift to the left or right, which would indicate a yaw rotation. Instead, the blurriness suggests a possible rotational movement, but it is not strong enough to definitively classify as a leftward or rightward rotation.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The primary difference between the two images is the blurriness in the target image, which suggests motion. However, there is no clear indication of a leftward or rightward rotation based on the positioning of objects.\n- Since the question specifies that the dominant motion is a yaw rotation (leftward or rightward), and there is no clear evidence of such a rotation, the most reasonable conclusion is that there was no significant movement.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The lack of a clear shift in object positions and the presence of motion blur suggest that the camera may have moved slightly, but not in a way that indicates a distinct leftward or rightward rotation. Therefore, the most accurate choice is that there was no significant movement.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

This suggests that the camera has moved or rotated away from the mannequin head.\n- **Perspective Change:** The target image focuses more on the desk area, specifically the keyboard and monitor, indicating a shift in the camera's field of view.\n- **Blurriness:** The blurriness in the target image could be due to a quick movement or rotation of the camera, but it does not necessarily indicate a different type of movement like panning or zooming.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe disappearance of the mannequin head and the shift in focus toward the desk area suggest that the camera has rotated horizontally. Since the mannequin head moves out of the frame and the desk area becomes more prominent, this indicates a **rightward rotation** of the camera.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the shift in focus from the mannequin head to the desk area and the keyboard.</rsn>\n<ans>50</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
