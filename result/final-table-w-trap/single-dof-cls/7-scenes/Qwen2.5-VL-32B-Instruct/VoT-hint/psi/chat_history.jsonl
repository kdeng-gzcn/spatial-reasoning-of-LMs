This suggests there is no significant panning or tilting of the camera.\n   - The red cabinet and the display case also appear to be in the same locations, indicating no major shifts in the camera's horizontal or vertical alignment.\n\n2. **Orientation of the Scene**:\n   - Upon closer inspection, the perspective of the room seems slightly altered. The edges of the red shelf and the wall appear to have shifted subtly, suggesting a rotational movement rather than a linear one.\n   - In the target image, the red shelf and the wall seem to be more aligned with the camera's viewing angle compared to the source image. This indicates a slight rotation of the camera around its viewing axis.\n\n3. **Distinguishing Between Clockwise and Counterclockwise Rotation**:\n   - In the source image, the red shelf and the wall have a certain angular offset relative to the camera's field of view.\n   - In the target image, this angular offset appears reduced, as if the camera has rotated to align more directly with these elements.\n   - This reduction in angular offset suggests a **clockwise rotation** of the camera, as the objects now appear more centered and less skewed compared to the source image.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe primary change between the two images is the subtle alignment of the scene elements, indicating a rotational movement.

Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera roll rotation**, which means clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated clockwise (roll rotation clockwise)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |       | ----> |      ⭕️ |\n            |     ⭕️| ----> |        |\n            |       | ----> |        |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift counterclockwise in the target image, the camera most likely rotated clockwise.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated counterclockwise (roll rotation counterclockwise)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |       | ----> |        |\n            |     ⭕️| ----> |        |\n            |       | ----> |     ⭕️ |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift clockwise in the target image, the camera most likely rotated counterclockwise.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

The relative positions of these objects appear consistent, indicating no significant translation or panning.\n\n2. **Orientation Analysis**: \n   - In the source image, the objects appear slightly tilted, suggesting a skewed perspective.\n   - In the target image, the objects appear more level and aligned with the frame, indicating a correction in the camera's orientation.\n\n3. **Camera Roll Rotation**:\n   - The transition from the source to the target image shows a correction in the tilt of the objects. This suggests that the camera has been rotated around its viewing axis to align the scene more horizontally.\n   - The objects shifting from a skewed perspective to a leveled one indicates a counterclockwise rotation of the camera.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary change between the two images is the correction of the skewed perspective, which is indicative of a camera roll rotation. Since the objects become more aligned with the horizontal plane in the target image, it implies a counterclockwise rotation of the camera.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has undergone a counterclockwise rotation to correct the skewed perspective seen in the source image.</rsn>  \n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
