However, the angle at which they are viewed has changed, indicating a shift in the camera's position.\n\n4. **Perspective Change**:\n   - The target image shows more of the left side of the scene (e.g., the chair's backrest and the left edge of the table), suggesting that the camera has moved to the right. This is because objects on the left side become more prominent when the camera moves rightward.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The increase in visibility of the left side of the chair and table indicates that the camera has moved rightward. This is consistent with the concept of rightward translation, where objects on the left side of the frame become more prominent as the camera shifts to the right.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has moved rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the left side of the chair and table in the target image.</rsn>\n<ans>3</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved leftward (translation to the left)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   |  --->   |    ⭕️ |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the right in the target image, the camera most likely moved leftward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️      leftward translation      ⭕️\n            |       ----------->         |\n            📷                           📷\n\n            - Case 2: The camera moved rightward (translation to the right)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |    ⭕️ |  --->   | ⭕️    |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the left in the target image, the camera most likely moved rightward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️     rightward translation     ⭕️\n            |       ----------->                |\n            📷                                  📷\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This is because objects in the scene will appear to move in the opposite direction of the camera's movement.\n   - This aligns with the concept of leftward translation, where the camera moves left, causing the scene to appear as if it is shifting right.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the observed shift of the staircase and railing to the right in the target image, the camera must have moved leftward horizontally.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The staircase and railing appear to have shifted to the right in the target image compared to the source image. This indicates that the camera has moved leftward horizontally.</rsn>  \n<ans>14</ans>  ", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
