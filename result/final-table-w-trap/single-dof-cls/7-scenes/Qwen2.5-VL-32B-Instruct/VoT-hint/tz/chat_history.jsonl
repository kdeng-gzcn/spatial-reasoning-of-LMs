This suggests that the camera has moved closer to the objects, making them appear larger and clearer.\n\n2. **Focus and Clarity**:\n   - The source image has a noticeable blur, indicating that the camera might have been out of focus or at a greater distance.\n   - The target image is much sharper, suggesting that the camera has either refocused or moved closer to the scene.\n\n3. **Perspective and Scale**:\n   - The relative sizes of objects in the target image appear larger compared to the source image.
