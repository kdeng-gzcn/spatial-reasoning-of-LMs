Specifically, the angle at which the shelf and objects are viewed seems to have shifted. This suggests a rotational movement rather than a translation (movement along an axis).\n\n3. **Rotation Direction**: The shift in perspective indicates a rotation around the camera's viewing axis. Comparing the two images, it appears that the camera has rotated slightly clockwise. This is evident from the change in the angle at which the objects are presented relative to the camera's field of view.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The objects remain in the same positions, ruling out any translational movements.\n- The change in perspective is consistent with a rotational movement.\n- The direction of the rotation appears to be clockwise when transitioning from the source image to the target image.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera movement between the two images is a clockwise rotation along its viewing axis.</rsn>\n<ans>12</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera roll rotation**, which means clockwise or counterclockwise rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
