In the source image, more of the right side of the countertop is visible, including items like brochures and a laptop.\n   - In the target image, the view is more centered, and less of the right side is visible compared to the source image. This suggests a rotation of the camera rather than a translation (movement forward, backward, up, or down).\n\n3. **Camera Movement Analysis**:\n   - The shift in perspective indicates that the camera has rotated horizontally. Since the right side of the countertop becomes less visible in the target image, it implies that the camera has rotated to the left.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary change between the two images is the horizontal shift in perspective, where the right side of the countertop becomes less visible.

However, the positioning and visibility of these objects have changed slightly.\n\n2. **Shelf Visibility**: In the source image, the shelf is more prominently visible, with its contents partially obscured due to the angle. In the target image, the shelf is still visible, but the camera appears to have shifted slightly, providing a clearer view of the items on the shelf.\n\n3. **Desk and Chair**: The desk and chair are more clearly visible in the target image compared to the source image. This suggests that the camera has moved or rotated to bring these elements into a more direct line of sight.\n\n4. **Overall Perspective**: The overall perspective in the target image seems to be more aligned with the room's layout, indicating that the camera might have rotated to capture a broader view of the space.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary change between the two images is the improved alignment and clarity of the desk, chair, and shelf. This suggests that the camera has rotated to the left, bringing these elements into a more central and clear view. The shift in perspective is consistent with a leftward rotation rather than any other type of movement.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally to provide a clearer and more centered view of the room's elements.</rsn>\n<ans>26</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

This indicates no change in the objects themselves.\n\n2. **Chair Positioning**: In both images, the chairs are visible around the table. However, the angle at which the chairs are seen has changed slightly. In the target image, the chair on the left appears more prominently in the foreground compared to the source image.\n\n3. **Background Elements**: The background elements, such as the red wall and the desk with items on it, appear slightly shifted in perspective. This suggests a change in the camera's orientation rather than a change in the objects' positions.\n\n4. **Camera Perspective**: The overall framing of the scene suggests that the camera has rotated horizontally. The shift in the visibility of the chair and the slight change in the angle of the background elements indicate a rotation rather than a translation (movement in a straight line).\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The primary change between the two images is the altered perspective of the chairs and the background. This suggests a horizontal rotation of the camera.\n- Since the chair on the left becomes more prominent in the target image, it implies that the camera has rotated to the right, bringing that chair into a more central position in the frame.\n\n### Final Decision:\nThe camera movement is a rightward rotation.\n\n<rsn>The change in the prominence of the chair on the left and the shift in the background elements suggest a rightward rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n<ans>5</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

The target image shows more of the right side of the room compared to the source image.\n\n2. **Perspective Change**:\n   - The target image includes more of the right side of the room, such as additional items on the desk and a clearer view of the wall and window.\n   - This indicates that the camera has rotated to the right, bringing more of the right side into view.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The primary change between the two images is the shift in perspective, which suggests a horizontal rotation of the camera.\n   - Since the right side of the room becomes more prominent in the target image, the camera must have rotated rightward.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture more of the right side of the room.</rsn>\n<ans>37</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This suggests a change in the camera's angle rather than a change in the objects' positions.\n\n3. **Whiteboard**: In the target image, a whiteboard with writing becomes visible on the left side of the frame. This indicates that the camera has moved or rotated to include more of the left side of the room.\n\n4. **Overall Room Layout**: The overall layout of the room remains consistent, but the inclusion of the whiteboard and the slight shift in the perspective of the monitors suggest a horizontal rotation.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary change between the two images is the appearance of the whiteboard on the left side of the frame. This indicates that the camera has rotated to the left, bringing more of the left side of the room into view. There is no indication of panning, tilting, or zooming; the change is purely rotational.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally to include the whiteboard in the frame.</rsn>\n<ans>6</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
