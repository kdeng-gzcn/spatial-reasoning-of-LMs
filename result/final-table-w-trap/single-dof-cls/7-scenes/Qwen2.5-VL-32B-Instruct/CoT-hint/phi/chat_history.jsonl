The left monitor in the source image is no longer visible in the target image, indicating a shift in perspective.\n   - The whiteboard, which was partially visible on the left in the source image, is now fully visible in the target image.\n\n3. **Camera Movement Analysis**:\n   - The change in the visibility of the whiteboard and the disappearance of the left monitor suggest that the camera has rotated to the right. This would align with a rightward rotation (yaw) of the camera.\n\nGiven these observations, the camera movement can be concluded as a rightward rotation.\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated to the right, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the whiteboard on the left and the disappearance of the left monitor, which indicates a shift in the field of view towards the right.</rsn>\n\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
