The pieces are slightly tilted.\n   - In the target image, the chessboard is now more aligned with the edges of the image, and the pieces appear straighter.\n\n2. **Position of Objects**:\n   - The table, chairs, and other objects around the chessboard maintain their relative positions to each other. This suggests there is no significant translation or panning of the camera.\n   - The primary change is in the orientation of the chessboard and the pieces, indicating a rotational movement.\n\n3. **Rotation Direction**:\n   - Comparing the source and target images, the chessboard has been rotated in such a way that the pieces that were previously tilted now appear straight. This indicates a counterclockwise rotation when viewed from above.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The chessboard and pieces have been rotated counterclockwise.\n- There is no indication of translation, zooming, or other types of movement.\n- The alignment of the chessboard with the image edges in the target image confirms the counterclockwise rotation.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has undergone a counterclockwise rotation to align the chessboard more directly with the image edges.</rsn>\n<ans>51</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
