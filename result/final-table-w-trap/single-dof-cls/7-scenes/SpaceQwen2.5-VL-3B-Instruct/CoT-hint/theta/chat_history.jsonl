They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera pitch rotation**, which means upward or downward rotation.\n            \n            Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below are some cues to help you reason through this task step by step.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated upward (pitch rotation upward)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted downward relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely rotated upward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated downward (pitch rotation downward)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted upward relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely rotated downward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
