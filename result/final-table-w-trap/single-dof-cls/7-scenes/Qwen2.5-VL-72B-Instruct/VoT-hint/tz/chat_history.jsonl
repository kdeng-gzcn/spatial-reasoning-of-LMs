In the target image, the coffee machines and surrounding objects appear slightly smaller compared to their appearance in the source image. This suggests that the camera has moved backward, as objects would naturally appear smaller when viewed from a greater distance. There is no indication of rotation or other types of movement, so the primary change is a backward translation.\n</rsn>\n<ans>12</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
