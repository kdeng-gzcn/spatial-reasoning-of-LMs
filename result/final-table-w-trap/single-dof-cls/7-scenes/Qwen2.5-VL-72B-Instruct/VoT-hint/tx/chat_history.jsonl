Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved leftward (translation to the left)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   |  --->   |    ⭕️ |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the right in the target image, the camera most likely moved leftward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️      leftward translation      ⭕️\n            |       ----------->         |\n            📷                           📷\n\n            - Case 2: The camera moved rightward (translation to the right)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |    ⭕️ |  --->   | ⭕️    |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the left in the target image, the camera most likely moved rightward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️     rightward translation     ⭕️\n            |       ----------->                |\n            📷                                  📷\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This indicates that the camera has moved to the right, as the objects in the scene seem to move left relative to the camera's new position. Therefore, the dominant motion is a rightward translation.</rsn>\n\n<ans>27</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
