In the source image, more of the yellow wall and the corner are visible, while in the target image, these elements are less prominent, and the staircase occupies more of the frame. This suggests that the camera has moved to the right, reducing the visibility of the wall and bringing the staircase into greater focus. Thus, the dominant motion is a rightward translation.</rsn>\n\n<ans>27</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
