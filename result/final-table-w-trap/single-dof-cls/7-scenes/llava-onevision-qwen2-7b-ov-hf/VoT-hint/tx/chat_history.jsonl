There is no clear indication of the camera moving leftward or rightward, as the objects do not show any noticeable shift in their positions. Therefore, the most likely answer is that there was no movement of the camera between the two images.</rsn>\n<ans>1</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved leftward (translation to the left)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ‚≠ïÔ∏è   |  --->   |    ‚≠ïÔ∏è |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the right in the target image, the camera most likely moved leftward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ‚≠ïÔ∏è      leftward translation      ‚≠ïÔ∏è\n            |       ----------->         |\n            üì∑                           üì∑\n\n            - Case 2: The camera moved rightward (translation to the right)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |    ‚≠ïÔ∏è |  --->   | ‚≠ïÔ∏è    |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the left in the target image, the camera most likely moved rightward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ‚≠ïÔ∏è     rightward translation     ‚≠ïÔ∏è\n            |       ----------->                |\n            üì∑                                  üì∑\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
