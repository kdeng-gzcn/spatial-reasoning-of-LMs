They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
