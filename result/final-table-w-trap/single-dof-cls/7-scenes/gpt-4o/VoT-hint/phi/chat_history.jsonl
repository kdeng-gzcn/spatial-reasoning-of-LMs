Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated leftward (yaw rotation to the left)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   |  --->   |    ⭕️ |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the right in the target image, the camera most likely rotated leftward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️      leftward rotation      ⭕️\n            |       ----------->         |\n            📷                           📷\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated rightward (yaw rotation to the right)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |    ⭕️ |  --->   | ⭕️    |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the left in the target image, the camera most likely rotated rightward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️     rightward rotation     ⭕️\n            |       ----------->            |\n            📷                              📷\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
