For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means forward or backward translation.\n            \n            Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below are some cues to help you reason through this task step by step.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved forward (translation forward)\n            If the objects in the target image appear larger or closer relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely moved forward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera moved backward (translation backward)\n            If the objects in the target image appear smaller or farther away relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely moved backward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
