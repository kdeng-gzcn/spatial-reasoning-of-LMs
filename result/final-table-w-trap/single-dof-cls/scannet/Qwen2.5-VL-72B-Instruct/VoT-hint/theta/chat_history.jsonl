Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera pitch rotation**, which means upward or downward rotation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated upward (pitch rotation upward)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   | ---->  |       |\n            |       | ---->  |  ⭕️   |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift downward in the target image, the camera most likely rotated upward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated downward (pitch rotation downward)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |       | ---->  |   ⭕️  |\n            |   ⭕️  | ---->  |       |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift upward in the target image, the camera most likely rotated downward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
