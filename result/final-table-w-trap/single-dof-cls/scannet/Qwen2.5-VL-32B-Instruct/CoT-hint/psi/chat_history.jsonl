The edges and angles of the objects appear to have rotated relative to the frame of the image.\n\n2. **Identifying Rotation**:\n   - The router and its antennas, as well as the monitor, seem to have rotated slightly within the frame.

The lines and patterns on the wall and radiator appear to have shifted slightly, suggesting a rotational movement.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Direction of Rotation\n- In the target image, the vertical lines of the radiator and the patterns on the wall appear to be more aligned with the edges of the frame compared to the source image.\n- This alignment suggests that the camera has rotated slightly, making the vertical elements appear more upright.\n- The shift indicates a **counterclockwise rotation** because the objects in the target image appear to have moved in a direction consistent with a counterclockwise turn of the camera.\n\n### Step 3: Rule Out Other Movements\n- There is no evidence of panning (horizontal or vertical movement) or tilting (upward or downward rotation) since the relative positions of the radiator and wall remain consistent.\n- The lighting and shadows also appear consistent, ruling out zooming or changes in distance.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe primary change between the source and target images is the orientation of the scene, which is best explained by a counterclockwise rotation of the camera.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The comparison of the source and target images shows that the camera has rotated counterclockwise.
