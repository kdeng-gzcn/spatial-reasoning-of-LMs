This is a clear indication of a **rightward yaw rotation**.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The pipe in the target image appears to have shifted to the left compared to its position in the source image. This shift is best explained by the camera rotating rightward horizontally, as there are no other indications of zoom, tilt, or translation.

Specifically, the poster with \"drone.io\" has moved further to the left, while the poster with \"FLA TEA COLLEC.\" has moved further to the right.\n\n2. **Orientation of the Hallway**:\n   - The hallway itself appears to be straight, and the alignment of doors and walls suggests no significant panning or tilting of the camera.\n   - The shift in the position of the posters indicates a horizontal movement rather than a vertical or depth-related change.\n\n3. **Relative Position of Objects**:\n   - The posters and other elements on the wall have shifted horizontally, suggesting that the camera has rotated rather than translated linearly.\n   - Since the posters that were initially more centered in the source image are now more towards the edges in the target image, it implies a rotation of the camera.\n\n4. **Conclusion Based on Movement**:\n   - The posters shifting to the left in the target image compared to the source image indicate that the camera has rotated to the right.

This is characteristic of a **rightward rotation** of the camera.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The key elements in the scene (the black silhouette and the text) have shifted to the right, and new elements (like the lamp) have become visible on the right side.

This suggests that the camera has rotated rather than panning or translating linearly.\n\n4. **Dominant Movement**:\n   - The shift in the position of the door and the items on the shelf indicates a horizontal rotation of the camera. Since the objects appear to have moved to the left in the target image, this implies that the camera has rotated to the right.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the change in the relative positions of the door and the items on the shelf.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The objects in the target image appear shifted to the left relative to their positions in the source image, indicating that the camera rotated rightward horizontally.</rsn>\n<ans>37</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n            Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below are some cues to help you reason through this task step by step.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated leftward (yaw rotation to the left)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted to the right relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely rotated leftward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated rightward (yaw rotation to the right)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted to the left relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely rotated rightward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
