This indicates that the camera has moved or rotated to include this new element in the frame.\n- The silhouette and the wall appear to have shifted slightly to the left in the target image compared to the source image. This suggests a horizontal rotation rather than a translation (movement along a straight line).\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The appearance of the lamp post on the right side of the frame implies that the camera has rotated to the right. If the camera had simply panned or translated, the entire scene would have shifted uniformly without introducing new elements like the lamp post.\n- The shift of the silhouette and the wall to the left further supports the idea of a rightward rotation.

This indicates a shift in the camera's field of view.\n- The objects (folded clothes, dresser, and hanging clothes) have moved relative to the edges of the frame, suggesting a rotational movement rather than a linear translation.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The disappearance of the window and the repositioning of other objects suggest that the camera has rotated to the right. This is consistent with a rightward rotation (yaw), where objects on the left side of the frame move out of view, and those on the right become more prominent.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera movement between the source and target images is a **rightward rotation**.\n\n```plaintext\n<rsn>The key observation is the disappearance of the window and the repositioning of objects in the frame, indicating a rightward rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n<ans>12</ans>\n```", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

Instead, a filing cabinet is now prominently visible on the left side.\n\n2. **Background Elements**:\n   - The radiator and the wall behind it remain consistent in both images, indicating that the camera has not moved significantly in terms of zoom or vertical position.\n   - The window and the objects on the windowsill are also consistent, further suggesting that the camera's position relative to the background has not changed drastically.\n\n3. **Perspective Changes**:\n   - The angle at which the desk and other objects are viewed has shifted. In the source image, more of the right side of the desk is visible, while in the target image, more of the left side of the desk is visible.\n   - This suggests a horizontal rotation of the camera rather than a translation (movement forward, backward, up, or down).\n\n4. **Object Visibility**:\n   - The blue trash bin disappears as the camera rotates, and the filing cabinet becomes more prominent. This indicates a change in the field of view due to a rotational movement.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The consistent background elements (radiator, wall, window) suggest that the camera has not moved vertically or zoomed in/out.\n- The change in visibility of objects (blue trash bin disappearing and filing cabinet becoming prominent) indicates a horizontal rotation.\n- Since the blue trash bin moves out of the frame and the filing cabinet moves into the frame, the camera must have rotated **leftward** horizontally.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera movement is a **leftward rotation**.\n\n```xml\n<rsn>The consistent background and the change in visibility of foreground objects (blue trash bin disappearing and filing cabinet becoming prominent) indicate a leftward horizontal rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n<ans>37</ans>\n```", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated leftward (yaw rotation to the left)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   |  --->   |    ⭕️ |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the right in the target image, the camera most likely rotated leftward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️      leftward rotation      ⭕️\n            |       ----------->         |\n            📷                           📷\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated rightward (yaw rotation to the right)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |    ⭕️ |  --->   | ⭕️    |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the left in the target image, the camera most likely rotated rightward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️     rightward rotation     ⭕️\n            |       ----------->            |\n            📷                              📷\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This matches the observed shift of the large framed picture and other elements in the target image.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has undergone a **leftward rotation**. This is evident from the horizontal shift of objects in the scene, particularly the framed picture and posters on the wall.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward, as indicated by the horizontal shift of objects such as the framed picture and posters on the wall. Objects appear to move to the right in the target image, which is consistent with a leftward rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n<ans>6</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
