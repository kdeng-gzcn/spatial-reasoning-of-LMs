The target image appears to be a rotated version of the source image. Specifically, the scene looks like it has been rotated slightly clockwise.\n\n3. **Visual Clues**:\n   - The edges of the desk and the chair seem to have shifted in a way that suggests a rotational movement rather than a linear one.\n   - The angle at which the computer tower and cables are viewed has changed, further supporting the idea of rotation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The most significant change is the rotation of the entire scene, which indicates that the camera itself has rotated.\n\nGiven this analysis, the camera movement is a **clockwise rotation**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The primary change between the two images is the orientation of the scene, which suggests that the camera has rotated clockwise along its viewing axis.</rsn>  \n<ans>2</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
