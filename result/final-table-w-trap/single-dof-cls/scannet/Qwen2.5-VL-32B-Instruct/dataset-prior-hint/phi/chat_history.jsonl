In the target image, the window becomes more prominent, and more of the outside view is visible.

The perspective suggests the camera is positioned at a certain angle relative to the corner.\n- **Target Image**: The image also shows the same corner with tiled walls and a ceiling light fixture. However, the perspective appears slightly different, indicating a change in the camera's orientation.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes in Perspective\n- In the **source image**, the corner appears more open, and the tiles seem to extend further into the frame.\n- In the **target image**, the corner appears more closed, and the tiles seem to converge more quickly toward the center of the frame. This suggests that the camera has rotated slightly.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Direction of Rotation\n- The change in perspective indicates that the camera has rotated horizontally. Specifically, the tiles and the corner appear to have shifted in a way consistent with a **rightward rotation**. \n- If the camera had rotated leftward, the corner would appear more open, which is not the case here.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the Dominant Motion\n- The most significant change between the two images is the horizontal rotation of the camera. There is no indication of panning, tilting, zooming, or any other type of movement. The rotation is clearly the dominant motion.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture the target image from a slightly different angle compared to the source image.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The key features of the corner and tiles indicate a change in perspective due to horizontal rotation. The tiles and corner converge more quickly in the target image, suggesting a rightward rotation of the camera.

There is a black object (possibly a vent or fixture) on the ceiling, and the lighting creates shadows on the wall.\n- **Target Image**: The image also shows a corner with white tiles. The black object on the ceiling is still visible, but its position relative to the frame has changed. Additionally, there is now a visible door or opening on the right side of the image.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes\n- **Position of the Black Object**: In the source image, the black object is more centered in the upper part of the frame. In the target image, it appears shifted slightly to the left, indicating a change in the camera's horizontal orientation.\n- **New Feature (Door/Opening)**: The target image reveals a door or opening on the right side, which was not visible in the source image. This suggests that the camera has moved or rotated to include this new element in the field of view.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Camera Movement\n- The change in the position of the black object and the appearance of the door suggest that the camera has rotated horizontally. Since the door becomes visible on the right side, the camera must have rotated to the right.\n- There is no indication of panning (movement along a horizontal axis without rotation) or tilting (vertical rotation), as the overall framing and perspective remain consistent. The primary change is the inclusion of the door, which is best explained by a rightward rotation.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Answer Candidates\nThe dominant motion is a **rightward rotation**. Among the provided options, the correct choice is:\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as indicated by the change in the position of the black object and the appearance of the door on the right side of the frame.</rsn>\n\n<ans>5</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

The perspective suggests the camera is positioned at a certain angle relative to the corner.\n- **Target Image**: The image also shows the same corner with tiled walls and a ceiling light fixture. However, the perspective appears slightly different, indicating a change in the camera's orientation.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes in Perspective\n- In the **source image**, the corner appears more open, and the tiles seem to extend further into the frame.\n- In the **target image**, the corner appears more closed, and the tiles seem to converge more quickly toward the center of the frame. This suggests that the camera has rotated slightly.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Direction of Rotation\n- The change in perspective indicates that the camera has rotated horizontally. Specifically, the tiles and the corner appear to have shifted in a way consistent with a **rightward rotation**. \n- If the camera had rotated leftward, the corner would appear more open, which is not the case here.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm the Dominant Motion\n- The most significant change between the two images is the horizontal rotation of the camera. There is no indication of panning, tilting, zooming, or any other type of movement. The rotation is clearly the dominant motion.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture the target image from a slightly different angle compared to the source image.\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The key features of the corner and tiles indicate a change in perspective due to horizontal rotation. The tiles and corner converge more quickly in the target image, suggesting a rightward rotation of the camera.

There is a black object (possibly a vent or fixture) on the ceiling, and the lighting creates shadows on the wall.\n- **Target Image**: The image also shows a corner with white tiles. The black object on the ceiling is still visible, but its position relative to the frame has changed. Additionally, there is now a visible door or opening on the right side of the image.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes\n- **Position of the Black Object**: In the source image, the black object is more centered in the upper part of the frame. In the target image, it appears shifted slightly to the left, indicating a change in the camera's horizontal orientation.\n- **New Feature (Door/Opening)**: The target image reveals a door or opening on the right side, which was not visible in the source image. This suggests that the camera has moved or rotated to include this new element in the field of view.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Camera Movement\n- The change in the position of the black object and the appearance of the door suggest that the camera has rotated horizontally. Since the door becomes visible on the right side, the camera must have rotated to the right.\n- There is no indication of panning (movement along a horizontal axis without rotation) or tilting (vertical rotation), as the overall framing and perspective remain consistent. The primary change is the inclusion of the door, which is best explained by a rightward rotation.\n\n### Step 4: Match with Answer Candidates\nThe dominant motion is a **rightward rotation**. Among the provided options, the correct choice is:\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as indicated by the change in the position of the black object and the appearance of the door on the right side of the frame.</rsn>\n\n<ans>5</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

Their positions relative to each other appear consistent, indicating no significant panning or tilting.\n- **Desk and Books**: The desk with books is present in both images. However, the angle at which it is viewed has changed slightly.\n- **Chair**: The chair is visible in both images, and its position appears unchanged.\n- **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting and shadows on the wall and objects seem consistent, suggesting no major change in the light source direction.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Changes in Perspective\n- In the **source image**, the camera appears to be positioned more directly facing the wall and desk.\n- In the **target image**, the camera seems to have shifted slightly to the right, as indicated by the increased visibility of the blue object (possibly a figurine) on the left side of the desk. This suggests a rightward rotation of the camera.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Dominant Movement\nThe primary change between the two images is the shift in perspective, where the camera has rotated to the right, revealing more of the left side of the room. This indicates a **rightward rotation**.\n\n### Final Reasoning\nThe camera has rotated horizontally to the right, as evidenced by the change in the visibility of objects on the left side of the room (e.g., the blue figurine).\n\n### Response\n<rsn>The key difference between the two images is the increased visibility of the left side of the room, particularly the blue figurine on the desk. This suggests that the camera has rotated to the right, providing a broader view of the left side while maintaining the overall composition of the room.</rsn>\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
