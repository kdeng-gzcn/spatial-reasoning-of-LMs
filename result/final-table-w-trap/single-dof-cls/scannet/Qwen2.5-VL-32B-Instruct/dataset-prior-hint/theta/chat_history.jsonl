The bottom part of the bed and the floor are also partially visible.\n- In the **target image**, the bed is still visible, but the bottom part of the bed and the floor are no longer in view. The upper part of the wall and the headboard are more prominently displayed.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the change in perspective\n- The transition from the source image to the target image shows that the camera has moved in such a way that the lower portion of the bed and the floor have been cropped out. This indicates that the camera has rotated upward, focusing more on the upper part of the bed and the wall above it.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the type of movement\n- The movement is not a horizontal pan or a vertical slide, as the entire frame has shifted upward without changing the left-to-right alignment.\n- The movement is a **vertical rotation** where the camera tilts upward, bringing the upper part of the bed and the wall into a more prominent view while cropping out the lower part of the bed and the floor.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe camera movement between the source image and the target image is an **upward rotation**.\n\n<rsn>The key observation is that the lower part of the bed and the floor disappear in the target image, indicating that the camera has tilted upward, focusing more on the upper part of the bed and the wall.</rsn>\n\n<ans>37</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
