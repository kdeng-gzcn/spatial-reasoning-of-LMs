This suggests that the camera has moved closer to these objects.\n\n2. **Field of View**:\n   - The field of view in the target image is narrower than in the source image. This is another indication that the camera has moved forward, as a forward translation typically results in a narrower field of view due to the reduced distance between the camera and the objects.\n\n3. **Perspective Changes**:\n   - The perspective of the room appears more focused on the door and the cabinet in the target image, with less visibility of the surrounding areas (e.g., the wall on the right side and the floor area). This further supports the idea of a forward movement.\n\nGiven these observations, the most significant change is the apparent increase in size of the objects and the narrowing of the field of view, both of which are consistent with a forward translation of the camera.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- Objects appear larger in the target image.\n- The field of view is narrower in the target image.\n- The perspective is more focused on the central objects.\n\nThese cues strongly suggest that the camera moved forward.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The objects in the target image appear larger, and the field of view is narrower, indicating that the camera moved closer to the scene.
