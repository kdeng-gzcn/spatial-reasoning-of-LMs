However, in the target image, the sink appears more centered in the frame compared to the source image, where it is slightly off-center to the left.\n   - **Refrigerator**: The refrigerator is consistently positioned in both images, but its appearance changes slightly due to the camera angle.

This suggests a horizontal rotation rather than a vertical or linear movement.\n   - The door appears to have shifted from the right side of the frame to a more central position, indicating a leftward rotation of the camera.\n\n4. **Background and Foreground Consistency**:\n   - The overall layout of the kitchen remains consistent, with no indication of zooming in or out.\n   - The relative positions of the cabinets, stove, and microwave suggest that the camera has not moved linearly forward or backward.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe primary change between the two images is the repositioning of the door, which indicates a horizontal rotation of the camera. Since the door moves from the right side to a more central position, this implies a **leftward rotation**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated leftward horizontally to bring the door into a more central position in the frame.</rsn>\n<ans>15</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

In the target image, more of the wall on the left side is visible compared to the source image.\n   - The window and curtains appear more centered in the target image than in the source image.\n\n3. **Object Shifts**:\n   - The objects themselves have not moved, but their relative positions in the frame suggest a change in the camera's orientation.\n   - Specifically, the potted plant, which was more centrally located in the source image, now appears shifted to the left in the target image. This indicates a rotation of the camera rather than a translation.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - Since the objects have not physically moved, the change in their relative positions in the frame suggests a camera movement.\n   - The increased visibility of the left wall and the shift of the potted plant to the left indicate that the camera has rotated to the right.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture the target image from a slightly different angle.\n\n```xml\n<rsn>The analysis shows that the camera has rotated rightward, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the left wall and the shift of the potted plant to the left in the target image. This indicates a rightward rotation of the camera.</rsn>\n<ans>25</ans>\n```", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
