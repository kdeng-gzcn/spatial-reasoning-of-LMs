This indicates no change in the actual layout of the room.\n   - However, the relative positions of these objects in the frame have changed slightly.\n\n2. **Shift in Perspective**:\n   - In the **source image**, more of the left side of the room is visible, including a bookshelf and part of another desk.\n   - In the **target image**, the view has shifted slightly to the right, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the right side of the room, particularly the corner where the wall meets the door and the edge of the desk on the far right.\n\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - The objects on the left side of the room (e.g., the bookshelf) are less visible in the target image compared to the source image.\n   - Conversely, objects on the right side of the room (e.g., the desk near the door) are more visible in the target image.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The shift in perspective suggests that the camera has moved horizontally.

Its position relative to the room's walls appears consistent, indicating no significant rotation or tilt of the camera.\n- **Cabinet and Plant**: The cabinet and plant are also present in both images. Their relative positions to each other and to the whiteboard suggest no major changes in perspective.\n- **Tables and Chairs**: The tables and chairs are visible in both images.

The window and the desk with the computer monitor are less visible, while more of the right side of the room (including the door and the table near the door) is now in view.\n\n#### Step 3: Determine Camera Movement\n- The shift in visibility from the left side of the room to the right side of the room indicates a **rightward translation** of the camera. This means the camera has moved horizontally to the right, bringing more of the right side of the room into view.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe camera has moved rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the change in the visible portions of the room.

This indicates no rotation or scaling has occurred.\n   - The whiteboard, table, chairs, and other items are visible in both images, allowing us to compare their relative positions.\n\n2. **Position of the Table**:\n   - In the source image, the table is more centrally positioned within the frame.\n   - In the target image, the table appears to be shifted slightly to the left side of the frame. This suggests that the camera has moved relative to the table.\n\n3. **Perspective of the Room**:\n   - The angle of the room and the arrangement of chairs around the table remain the same, indicating no significant rotation.\n   - The shift in the position of the table and chairs relative to the edges of the frame suggests a horizontal translation.\n\n4. **Background Elements**:\n   - The windows, whiteboards, and other background elements also show a slight shift. Specifically, the whiteboard on the right side of the room becomes more prominent in the target image, further supporting the idea of a horizontal movement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe primary change between the two images is the shift in the position of the table and other objects relative to the camera.

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera translation**, which means leftward or rightward translation.\n            \n            Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below are some cues to help you reason through this task step by step.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera moved leftward (translation to the left)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted to the right relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely moved leftward.\n            \n            - Case 2: The camera moved rightward (translation to the right)\n            If the objects in the target image appear shifted to the left relative to their positions in the source image, then the camera most likely moved rightward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
