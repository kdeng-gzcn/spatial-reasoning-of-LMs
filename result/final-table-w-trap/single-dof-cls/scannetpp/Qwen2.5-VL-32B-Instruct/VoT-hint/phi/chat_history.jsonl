This indicates no vertical or horizontal panning.\n\n3. **Closet and Nightstand**:\n   - The closet and nightstand are visible in both images. Their positions relative to each other and the wall appear unchanged, suggesting no significant translation or zooming.\n\n4. **Additional Bed in Target Image**:\n   - In the target image, a second bed with colorful bedding becomes visible on the right side of the frame. This new element was not visible in the source image, indicating a change in the field of view.\n\n5. **Camera Movement**:\n   - The appearance of the second bed on the right side of the target image suggests that the camera has rotated to the right. This allows more of the right side of the room to come into view.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The consistent positioning of the bed, headboard, and other objects indicates that the camera has not moved vertically, horizontally, or zoomed in/out.\n- The emergence of the second bed on the right side of the target image strongly suggests a rightward rotation of the camera. This rotation expands the field of view to include elements that were previously out of frame.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe dominant camera movement is a rightward rotation.\n\n```plaintext\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward, as evidenced by the appearance of the second bed on the right side of the target image, which was not visible in the source image.

Instead, the focus has shifted more towards the center and right side of the kitchen area.\n   - The white cabinets and the notice on the wall remain visible in both images, but their positions relative to the frame have changed.\n\n2. **Position of Fixed Objects**:\n   - The white cabinets and the notice on the wall are still present but appear to have moved slightly to the left in the target image compared to the source image. This suggests a rotation rather than a translation (movement in a straight line).\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - Since the objects that were on the left side of the source image (corkboard and utensil rack) are no longer visible in the target image, and the central and right-side elements have become more prominent, it indicates that the camera has rotated to the right.\n   - A rightward rotation would cause objects on the left to move out of the frame and bring objects on the right into a more central position.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The camera has rotated rightward horizontally to capture more of the right side of the room while moving the left side out of view.\n\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as evidenced by the shift in the visibility of objects from the left side to the right side of the frame.</rsn>\n<ans>15</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

This indicates no significant change in the physical setup.\n   - The door, whiteboard, monitors, fan, and other objects are present in both images, suggesting no major positional changes in the environment.\n\n2. **Position of Objects Relative to the Camera**:\n   - In the **source image**, the door is more prominently visible on the left side, and the window with blinds is visible on the right side.\n   - In the **target image**, the door is still visible but appears slightly more centered compared to the source image.

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated leftward (yaw rotation to the left)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   |  --->   |    ⭕️ |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the right in the target image, the camera most likely rotated leftward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️      leftward rotation      ⭕️\n            |       ----------->         |\n            📷                           📷\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated rightward (yaw rotation to the right)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |    ⭕️ |  --->   | ⭕️    |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift to the left in the target image, the camera most likely rotated rightward.\n\n            Camera motion diagram:\n            ⭕️     rightward rotation     ⭕️\n            |       ----------->            |\n            📷                              📷\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This is consistent with the behavior described in the \"Case 2\" explanation provided in the prompt, where objects appear to shift to the left when the camera rotates rightward.\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\n- The objects in the room have not moved physically; instead, their apparent shift in position suggests a change in the camera's orientation.\n- The consistent shift of objects to the left in the target image implies a rightward rotation of the camera.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated rightward horizontally, as indicated by the shift of objects to the left in the target image.</rsn>\n<ans>25</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
