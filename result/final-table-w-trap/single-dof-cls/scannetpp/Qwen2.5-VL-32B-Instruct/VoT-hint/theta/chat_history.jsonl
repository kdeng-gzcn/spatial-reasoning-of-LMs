This is consistent with a pitch rotation upward, where the camera tilts to show more of the upper part of the scene and less of the lower part.\n\n### Final Decision:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated upward, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the ceiling and the reduced visibility of the lower part of the desk.</rsn>\n<ans>0</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera pitch rotation**, which means upward or downward rotation.\n            \n            Vision-of-Thought (VoT) Reasoning Hint:\n            Below is some **ASCII Art** to visually illustrate how to reason through this task.\n\n            - Case 1: The camera rotated upward (pitch rotation upward)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |  ⭕️   | ---->  |       |\n            |       | ---->  |  ⭕️   |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift downward in the target image, the camera most likely rotated upward.\n\n            - Case 2: The camera rotated downward (pitch rotation downward)\n\n            Example:\n            --------         --------\n            |       | ---->  |   ⭕️  |\n            |   ⭕️  | ---->  |       |\n            --------         --------\n            (source)         (target)\n\n            Interpretation:\n            If the object appears to shift upward in the target image, the camera most likely rotated downward.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.

This suggests that the camera has moved closer to these elements.\n   - The ceiling and upper parts of the walls are more visible in the target image, indicating an upward shift in the camera's field of view.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - The increase in the size of the window and radiator, along with the additional visibility of the ceiling, strongly suggests that the camera has rotated upward. This is consistent with a pitch rotation upward, where the camera tilts to capture more of the upper part of the room.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, the camera has rotated upward, as evidenced by the increased visibility of the ceiling and the larger appearance of lower elements like the window and radiator.\n\n<rsn>The primary change between the two images is the increased visibility of the ceiling and the larger appearance of lower elements, indicating an upward rotation of the camera.</rsn>  \n<ans>6.
