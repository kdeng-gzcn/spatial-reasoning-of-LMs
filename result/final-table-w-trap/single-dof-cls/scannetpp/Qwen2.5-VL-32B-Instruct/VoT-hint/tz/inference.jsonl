The objects in the adjacent room (e.g., desks, chairs, and bookshelves) appear relatively small and distant.\n   - In the target image, the camera is now positioned directly inside the adjacent room. The objects such as the desk, chairs, and bookshelves are much larger and more detailed, indicating that the camera has moved closer to them.\n\n2. **Field of View**:\n   - The source image shows a wider field of view that includes part of the kitchen area and the doorway leading into the adjacent room.\n   - The target image focuses more narrowly on the interior of the adjacent room, with the camera now positioned inside it. This suggests that the camera has moved forward into the room.\n\n3. **Perspective Changes**:\n   - The perspective in the source image shows the doorway as a frame leading into the adjacent room. In the target image, the camera is no longer at the doorway but is instead inside the room, providing a direct view of the interior details.\n\nGiven these observations, the camera has moved forward from the kitchen area into the adjacent room, resulting in a closer view of the objects inside.", "pred": "forward", "label": "forward", "is_correct": true, "is_parse": true, "round": 0}
