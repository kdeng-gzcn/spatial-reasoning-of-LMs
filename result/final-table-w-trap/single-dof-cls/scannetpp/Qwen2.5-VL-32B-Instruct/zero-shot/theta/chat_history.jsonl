In the target image, more of the ceiling is visible, indicating an upward shift in the camera's perspective.\n   - The fan and the boxes appear slightly smaller in the target image, which could be due to a slight zoom-out effect, but the primary change is vertical rather than horizontal or zoom-related.\n\n3. **Lighting and Shadows**:\n   - The lighting conditions appear consistent between the two images, with no significant changes in shadow placement or intensity, suggesting the light sources have not moved.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary difference between the two images is the increased visibility of the ceiling in the target image.
