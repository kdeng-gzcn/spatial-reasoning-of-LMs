However, the angle at which these elements are captured has changed slightly.\n   - **Sofa and Wall Decor**: The sofa and the world map on the wall are also present in both images. The relative positions of these objects suggest a change in the camera's orientation rather than a shift in position.\n   - **Lighting and Shadows**: The lighting appears consistent, indicating no significant change in the time of day or light sources.\n\n2. **Perspective Analysis**:\n   - In the source image, the camera seems to be positioned more towards the left side of the room, capturing more of the kitchen area.\n   - In the target image, the camera appears to have shifted slightly to the right, providing a broader view of the sofa and the wall decor while still including the kitchen area.\n\n3. **Dominant Movement**:\n   - The change in perspective suggests that the camera has rotated horizontally rather than panning or moving linearly. The shift in the angle at which the kitchen and living area are viewed indicates a rotation.\n   - Specifically, the camera seems to have rotated to the right, as more of the right side of the room (sofa and wall decor) is now visible compared to the source image.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe primary change between the two images is the horizontal rotation of the camera.

This is evident from the change in the visible portions of the room, where the right side becomes more prominent in the target image compared to the source image.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<rsn>The camera has rotated to the right, as indicated by the change in the visible portions of the room, with more of the right side becoming visible in the target image.</rsn>  \n<ans>37</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}

They are in the same scene but from source viewpoint and target viewpoint, respectively.\n\n        Task:\n        Suppose you are holding a camera, starting from source image viewpoint and moving to target image viewpoint. Your task is to determine the camera movement between the two images.\n        \n            Further Explanation:\n            To simplify this question, note that the given image pair is generated by moving the camera along only one of its six degrees of freedom (DoF). Therefore, you do not need to estimate the motion across all six DoFs. Instead, focus solely on identifying the most significant DoF in this scenario. For this task, the dominant motion is a **camera yaw rotation**, which means leftward or rightward rotation.\n            \n        Answer Candidates:\n        0.
