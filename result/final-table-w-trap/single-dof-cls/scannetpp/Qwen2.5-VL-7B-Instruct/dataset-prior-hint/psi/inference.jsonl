In the first image, the faucet is more prominently visible, while in the second image, the faucet is less prominent and the view seems to be slightly shifted. This suggests that the camera has moved in a way that changes the angle of view, indicating a rotation rather than a translation. Given the options provided, the most likely movement is a counterclockwise rotation, as the faucet and other elements appear to have shifted to the left side of the frame.", "pred": "counterclockwise", "label": "clockwise", "is_correct": false, "is_parse": true, "round": 0}
