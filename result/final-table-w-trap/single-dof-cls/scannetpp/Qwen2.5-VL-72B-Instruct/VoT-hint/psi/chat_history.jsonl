In the source image, the window frame and the edges of the furniture appear slightly tilted compared to the target image. In the target image, these elements seem more aligned with the horizontal and vertical axes of the frame. This suggests that the camera was rotated slightly in the source image and has been corrected in the target image.\n\nBy comparing the positions of the objects like the window frame, the desk, and the bed, it's clear that they have shifted in a manner consistent with a counterclockwise rotation. Specifically, the window frame, which was tilted to the right in the source image, is now more upright in the target image. This indicates that the camera was rotated counterclockwise to achieve the alignment seen in the target image.\n</rsn>\n\n<ans>3</ans>", "model": "vlm", "round": 0}
