They can be the reference objects to help you understand the camera motion.\n1: Computers on White Desk\n2: Office Chair\n</objects>\n\n<hint>\n1: The Computers on White Desk looks to move downward from the source viewpoint to the target viewpoint.\n2: The Office Chair looks to move downward from the source viewpoint to the target viewpoint.\n</hint>\n\n<thinking>\nThe camera-perspective and object-perspective are inverse, causing the camera movement to appear reversed relative to the object's movement.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer-candidates>\n0. Downward Translation - The camera translates downward from source viewpoint to target viewpoint.\n1. Upward Translation - The camera translates upward from source viewpoint to target viewpoint.\n</answer-candidates>\n\n<output-format>\nPlease output your reasoning in <rsn></rsn> XML tags first, and then output the index of the answer-candidate you choose in <ans></ans> XML tags.
